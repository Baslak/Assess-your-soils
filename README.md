<h4>About this app:</h4>

A lot of vineyard growers struggle to keep updated records and a careful spray diary. Furthermore, it's quite common for people to incorrectly apply the wrong product or spray rate if they are out in the field. 

This app is designed to help growers calculate quickly and accurately the desired rates for their vineyard according to size, depending on what stage the vineyard is at in the season.

A common measure of vineyard development that is widely used is the <em>Modified E-L System by Coombe and Dry</em>See below: <br>

This app uses this EL tool to determine what chemicals and rates are required for your vineyard based on size.

This app was originally intended to be a soil asssessment but the access to API documentation was limited.

The app intends to allow users to add, edit, and delete vineyards and to calculate chemical rates.
